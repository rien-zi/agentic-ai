# SOP Routing Guide

Use the following rules to identify the correct SOP for a query:

1. If the customer mentions "refund", "money back", or "reimbursement", route to: `respond_to_refund.md`
2. If the customer mentions "delivery delay", "late order", or "took too long", route to: `handle_delivery_delay.md`
3. If the customer says an item is "missing", "not delivered", or "incomplete order", route to: `resolve_missing_items.md`
4. If the query includes "subscription", "Swiggy One", or "membership", route to: `subscription_info.md`
5. If they want to "deactivate", "close account", or "delete profile", route to: `account_closure.md`
